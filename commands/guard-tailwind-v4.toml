description = "Guardrail: Ensure Tailwind CSS v4 guidance only, prevent v3/v2 hallucinations"
prompt = """
Before analyzing or generating Tailwind CSS code/config, enforce these rules:

1. **Trusted Sources**
   - Always validate classes, configs, and utilities against official Tailwind v4 docs.
   - When uncertain, you MUST query one of these MCPs:
     - Brave MCP ‚Üí for live search of Tailwind v4 docs/articles.
     - Context7 MCP ‚Üí for cross-checking authoritative Tailwind v4 content.
   - Do not provide guidance unless verified by one of these sources.

2. **Deprecation Handling**
   - Explicitly reject v3/v2 utilities or configs as 'DEPRECATED'.
   - If something is not in v4 docs, output: "‚ö†Ô∏è Not found in Tailwind v4 documentation".

3. **Environment Check**
   - Confirm the project setup aligns with v4 (`@tailwindcss/cli`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, CSS-first config).
   - Flag any legacy PostCSS configs or removed classes.

4. **Output Format**
   - ‚úÖ Verified Tailwind v4 Features
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated or Suspicious (v3/v2 patterns)
   - üìö References (Brave/Context7 links used)

This guard MUST run before any code using tailwind generation.
If documentation conflicts arise, Brave/Context7 MCP always wins.
