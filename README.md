# Gemini Custom Slash Commands

This repository contains **custom slash commands** for [Gemini CLI](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli) aimed at **Vibe Coding** projects, including Angular, Tailwind v4, accessibility, and more. These commands are designed to **boost productivity, enforce best practices, and prevent common AI hallucinations** in evolving frameworks.

## âš¡ Features

- **/audit_accessibility** â€“ Full WCAG 2.2 audit with semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and contrast checks. Produces a detailed analysis + actionable task list.  
- **/audit_tailwind_v4** â€“ Audit Tailwind v4 projects for best practices, deprecated v3 utilities, design consistency, and CSS layering. Uses Brave and Context7 MCPs for fact-checking. Produces a detailed analysis + actionable task list.
- **/audit_angular** â€“ Angular code audit based on Angular CLI MCP best practices: performance, modern patterns, and maintainability. Produces a detailed analysis + actionable task list.
- **/guard_tailwind_v4** â€“ Prevents hallucination of v3 patterns. Ensures all Tailwind v4 guidance is verified via official docs or trusted MCPs.
- **/self-reflect** - Reflect on my VibeCoding journey logs (chat history), detect repeated patterns, and propose rules to improve. Produces a detailed analysis + actionable task list.

## ðŸ§  Vibe Coding Integration

These commands are designed to fit your **Vibe Coding workflow**:  

- Combine **experiments + community sharing**: audit outputs can be used to generate articles or blog posts.  
- **Prevent repetition**: guard commands reduce errors when AI misaligns with evolving libraries.  
- **Anchored in reality**: Brave MCP and Context7 are used to fetch live docs to avoid hallucinations.
